Welcome to the SurfScape Community Initiative, a space where everyone can come together to support the project.

The main goal is to grow SurfScape with those who believe in it, whether you are a developer, designer, tester, or just someone who enjoys our work and want to support and help us.

## Goals

{{ card(title="Open Contributions and Support ", description="Promote community-led development through open discussions and pull requests, help people in need, and promote community-built extensions, themes, and forks.", type="minimal") }}

## Getting Involved

We currently have our official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dY4GSudRxv) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/surfscape/discussions) available, but we are gathering resources to have new ways of communication that are less restrict and more privacy respective.
