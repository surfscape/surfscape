## Preamble

At SurfScape, we value transparency and user trust. Celer is designed to be privacy-respecting. This document explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what your rights are as a user.

## Data Collection and Usage

Celer primarily works offline and does not collect any personal or usage data.

We do not monitor your system, track your activity, or gather crash reports. All actions performed by the app are executed locally on your machine.

## Internet Connectivity & Opt-In Features

Celer does not require an internet connection to function. All core features operate fully offline.

The only online component is the **SurfScape Gateway** service, used exclusively to fetch updated cleaning signatures. This feature is **opt-in** and clearly presented in the onboarding process and through the app's settings.

If disabled, the user will be prompted to connect when the cleaning module is accessed. Alternatively, the module can be completely disabled.

- **There is no telemetry.**
- **No crash reports are sent.**
- **No background data collection occurs.**

We believe privacy is a fundamental right. No data is sent over the network unless explicitly allowed by you.

## Third-Party Services

Celer uses the following services:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/surfscape/celer) – for hosting source code, pipelines, and downloadable services
- [SurfScape Gateway](https://surfscape.github.io/gateway/) (opt-in) – for syncing updated data and enabling online features
- [Microsoft Defender PowerShell Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) (local only) – for security diagnostics

We do not share your data with any analytics providers, advertisers, or third-party services.

## SurfScape Rights

We reserve the right to:

- Modify data practices with prior notice
- Temporarily or permanently suspend the SurfScape Gateway
- Update this policy to comply with evolving legal frameworks
