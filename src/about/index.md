## Begin Your Journey

SurfScape is a project collective focused on developing software, services, and resources that help people like you to build their own space on the web.

The goal is to help users break away from corporate walled gardens and become more educated about digital privacy, web accessibility, and the importance of digital independence.

## A Small Backstory

SurfScape began in 2022 under the name NaviNet, with the simple goal of hosting a web portal for Flash games and a search engine dedicated to Neocities sites (basically a worse knockoff of [OpenBooks](https://openbooks.neocities.org/)).

Over time NaviNet changed, it migrated from GitHub Pages to Neocities, went through several name changes, and shifted focus from Flash games to services for the Neocities community (we still kept Flash games).

In 2023, the project adopted the name NetFind, and shortly after became what is now known as SurfScape. Since then, the site has gone through many revisions â€” not just in content, but in design too, experimenting with aesthetics ranging from Web 2.0 to Web3, Frutiger Aero, and more.

For the curious, most versions of SurfScape are archived on [web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/surfscape.neocities.org).
