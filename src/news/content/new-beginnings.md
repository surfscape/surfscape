History repeats itself and SurfScape is back, once again! Yeah I know, it's probably the 10th time I say SurfScape is back but I'm hoping this is the time that we do something useful for once (no promises though).

If you don't know who we are then welcome to the SurfScape project! We are a collective where the main goal is to develop fun stuff that help people, from software, apps, web services, and more, all around privacy and digital freedom.

This is our new website, much more polished than any other version we've released, and it will stay that way. No more unnecessary redesigns am I right?

Now, there are lot's of stuff to talk about, from project restructuring, a new face on team, and we are doing and will be doing in the near future. This will be (hopefully) answered in this post so let's get to it!

## Restructuring

Firstly there has been a lot of changes in the backend, from new upcoming project to the deprecation of others, to a slightly branding redesign and new eyes on the project.

We've decided to deprecate most of the old SurfScape projects, these include:

- GameVortex
- SurfKit
- Web Portal

Now most of these will come back in a different form but since we have new and more important work to do, the best way was to just archive these and move on.

For the new branding there is not a lot to talk about, we've gone back to the 2024 logo that features the complete _flower_, however the colors have changed and the logo is finally symmetrical! The new branding also feature a color scheme for light themes.

## New Projects

Now for the fun part, we have been, as some say, cooking. The major stuff we've been working on these past months include:

- A Windows toolbox called [Celer](/projects/celer) with management, cleaning, optimization, and privacy features.

- A weather app called [Nuage](/projects/nuage) with a focus on minimalism and privacy, created and being developed by [@Fl1x1n](https://github.com/Fl1x1n/).

- A minimal web app to save and organize bookmarks.

Talking about new projects, I'm now in charge of the [customWin project](https://github.com/customWin), created by my friend [jbcarreon123](https://jbcarreon123.nekoweb.org/). As such I've decided to move the project into the SurfScape collective since Celer is also a Windows app. This does not mean we are merging them, both will stay independent from each other.

The current goal is to fix open issues and then port most of the suite to the newest .NET version and move them from WinForms to WPF. This will require some time especially since we have other projects higher in backlog that need to be taken care of first.

## New Member

Yes, SurfScape is not a one-person project anymore! I've started SurfScape with a different name back in 2022 as a service provider for the Neocities community, now in 2025 we've expanded. My best friend [Fl1x1n](https://github.com/Fl1x1n/) decided to join the project and with that brought [Nuage](http://localhost:8080/projects/nuage/) to SurfScape's portfolio. I'm hoping that in a near future more people can come in into the project and grow their ideas with the us. Until then welcome the new member!

## Expansion and Close-up

And now for the final update, I'm happy to announce that SurfScape is now available on [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org)! This does not mean we are leaving Neocities, this is more of a way to join both communities together. So if you are on Nekoweb please give us a [follow](https://nekoweb.org/follow/surfscape). Thanks and bye!
